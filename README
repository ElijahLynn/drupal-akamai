INSTALLATION
======================================================

   of your Drupal installation.  Normally sites/all/modules/
   
2. Enable the akamai module on the Modules admin page (admin/build/modules)

3. You will also need a license to use Akamai's network, http://www.akamai.com/index.html.

======================================================
USAGE
======================================================
The module allows two forms of interaction for clearing the cache.
1. Block form :
  Enable this on the admin/build/block section of the admin UI and 
  put the block where you want.  This form will clear the path that is 
  listed above the button, (likely the page you are currently viewing).
  
2. Refresh Tool tab:
  The Refresh Tool tab is found at, admin/settings/akamai/refresh.  It is 
  part of the admin interface for this module.  From here you can list
  several paths to be cleared.

The Akamai module also offers integration with Context through the Context_http_header module.
